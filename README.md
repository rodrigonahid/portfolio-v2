# That's my portfolio

Yeah, I built it on my own, even the Web Design and UI,
and (you can have it here)[https://www.figma.com/file/oqxQFh816kaCYWzykghpRx/Portfolio-Rodrigo?node-id=0%3A1]!

## And is open-source too!

I really don't care if you copy me, shame on you!

## How you made it?

I built it on Next.JS 12.0.8 version. I used:

- Typescript
- Styled Components
- Axios
- ESLint
- Prismic.io (The CMS)
- i18n (internationalization or translation, call it what you want)
